# Human-centered protocols

We need <span class="orange">human-centered protocols</span> for all our
decision-making and planing.

Those may have drastic revolutionnary implications for our society.

Why don't we have more of them ? I believe that the biggest obstacle is that
there is still this unsolved problem of being able to prove humanhood online.

Some solutions are proposed by companies (Cloudflare, Google, Facebook),
states, or even coalition of states (euID). OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even propose
a worring solution based on a massive database of biometrics (Worldcoin).

Most of this solutions are based on centralized authorities, yet there is a
simple, decentralized alternative solely based on understandable maths: The
<span class="green">web-of-trust</span>.

The <span class="green">web-of-trust</span> propose to rely on trusting the
people we know offline, and rely on them to do the same. This is very similar
to adding friends on a social network. If you have a lot of common friends with
someone, you can expect this identity to map to a real person.

This is because you've been able to verify over time that your friends digital
accounts correspond to you real friends, and expect them to act honestly and do
the same.

An even more complete model would be <span class="darkgreen">hierchical
web-of-trust</span> were we'd add organisation identities. In this model,
individual can delegate the mathematics machinery to their local organisation.
Organisation are managed by one or more trusted adminstrator and can trust each
other to form their own web-of-trust, the difference being that an organisation
voice is weighted by the number of user they manage. (For exemple emails
@mit.edu can be seen as identities managed by the mit.edu organisation).
